# Job_Alert_Bot
A Python automation tool that monitors job postings on the **General Motors (GM)** careers website and sends SMS notifications when a matching position becomes available.  
Built using **Python**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Requests**, and **Twilio**. This project came about when a close friend frequently manually checked the website for updates and I thought it'd make a nice project
